# Calculator

This is a simple calculator project developed.
It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Additionally, I included features like exponentiation (power) and modulus to enhance functionality.

Project Approach

First, I identified the key operations required for the calculator.
I implemented each operation as a separate function to keep the code modular and readable.
The program prompts the user to input two numbers, with validation to ensure numeric input.
A menu allows the user to select which operation to perform.
The program runs in a loop, enabling multiple calculations without restarting.
I included error handling for cases such as division by zero and invalid inputs to improve robustness.
How the Code Works

The project is written in Python for simplicity and accessibility.
Functions for each arithmetic operation take two inputs and return the result.
User input is validated to prevent crashes and unexpected behavior.
The program outputs the result clearly and allows the user to continue or exit.
Friendly messages guide the user in case of errors or invalid choices.
